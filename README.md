## Commentary
I had no idea what I was making when I got into this.
The code is all over the place and I tried to create something
that would have been easier to do in C++... Polymorphism.
The more you look into flow.c and flow.h you will see the
(admittedly bad) attempt to make semi-polymorphic structs.
I still need to get a virtual table going if I truly want to make
something like that viable.

Play arround with it. You may have fun! I will add a box in one of the
corners that tells you what you ought to do for the next action.
